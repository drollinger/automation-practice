# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language.
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
*   Focusing on what is best for the community.
*   Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
    advances.
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
    address, without explicit permission.
*   Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the forum in
    which it occurs.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.


## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts in an open source project can take many forms, from someone having a bad day and using harsh and hurtful language in the issue queue, to more serious instances such as sexist/racist statements or threats of violence, and everything in between.

If the behavior is threatening or harassing, or for other reasons requires immediate escalation, please see below.

However, for the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after that fails to escalate further. This approach gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. 

If you are experiencing or witnessing conflict, we ask you to use the following escalation strategy to address the conflict:

1.  Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably in a
    real-time medium.
2.  If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with
    background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.
3.  If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to
    harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.

## Reporting Violations

Info

## Enforcement

If the Project Stewards receive a report alleging a violation of the Code of Conduct, the Project Stewards will notify the accused of the report, and provide them an opportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is issued. The Project Stewards will do their utmost to keep the reporter anonymous. If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), the Project Stewards may issue sanctions without notice.
